            The GDPR applies to you if you hold any data on anyone in the EU. This means if you have any customers in the EU or if you have anyone in the EU on your list or if your website uses tracking cookies or pixels and anyone from the EU visits your site. It doesn’t matter where you are in the world, if you hold data on anyone in the EU, this applies to you and your business. It is a legal requirement and you must comply.

          <p>Although it is an European reglementation, GDPR has worldwide effect. The penalties include fines of up to €20 Million or 4% of annual global revenue whichever is the larger, according to <a href="gdpr#article83" target="_blank">Article 83 of GDPR</a>. In order to protect the privacy of the data of its people, EU takes a major stride forward with GDPR and therefore will be using every means available to enforce, including international treaties. Considering those penalties, if your business processes EU residents’ personal data, you would take a major risk by not complying with the law. </p>
          <p>Finally, GDPR allows data subjects to sue data controllers in case of a data privacy breach or a misuse of their data.</p>

          <p>The data protection representative’s active duties are: cooperate with data protection authorities and maintain records of processing activities, which the company that appoints the representative has to prepare and provide to the representative. Then, if you do not designate a DPR, you may fall under <a href="gdpr#article83" target="_blank">Article 83.4</a>, as a failure to designate a local representative, which brings you to the risk of a fine. Therefore, GDPR compliance means consistency, such as  continuous monitoring and updates of your data processing.</p>

          <p>The EU recognises some countries as having data protection laws which are equivalent to those in the EU. These are the other EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) as well as Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay. The EU permits transfers of data to these countries without extra measures being put in place, such as binding corporate rules etc. The USA has a similar arrangement via the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank">Privacy Shield</a>.</p>
          <p>However, this does not remove the need for a Data Protection Representative (<a href="gdpr#article49" target="_blank">See Article 49 of GDPR</a>). The equivalent regulation relates to data transportation across international boundaries but makes no difference to the obligation on a non-EU data controller or processor requiring an EU-based Data Protection Representative under <a href="gdpr#article27" target="_blank">Article 27 of GDPR</a>.</p>
