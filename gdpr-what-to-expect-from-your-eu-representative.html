    <p>As many know by now, any company outside of Europe, interacting with European citizens, is entitled to have an official representative in Europe. Well “entitled” is not really the right word as it is compulsory but as it is a real opportunity, rather than a constraint, “entitled” conveys the right idea.</p>
    <p>Since May 25th 2018 the GDPR forbids any company to do business or to collect any information regarding European citizens unless it has offices in Europe or, at least, an EU Representative. Offices will often be out of reach for non EU companies so an EU Representative will be the right choice. The question is “Which EU representative do I need?”.</p>
    <p>If you look around on the net there are many EU DPRs meaning EU Data Protection Representatives (such as eudpr.com of course). The prices are often quite low and the proposed services quite sufficient. It is nevertheless important to understand what you are getting for your subscription fee.</p>
    <p>The basic service provided by your EU Representative is to be your “interface” with Data Protection Authorities (DPA) and with your European users in regards to their data privacy requests. It is important to note that your EU Representative will share your company’s responsibilities and will therefore, very probably, perform a due diligence on your company before accepting the mission. Being responsible for your company, GDPR wise, should also encourage your EU Representative to be your best ally in regards to any questions you may have in regards to your compliance. This is a great advantage for companies which don’t have time to look into this regulation.</p>
    <p>Hence rather than taking the ostrich approach by burying a company’s head in the sand and hoping not to be seen, a company can lean on an EU Representative to reach GDPR compliance and even compliance in regards to other Data Privacy laws around the world. Besides being on the right side of the law it is, obviously, also reassuring for the end users.</p>
    <p>When choosing an EU DPR you need to figure out where your EU users are. If most of your EU users or clients are in a specific country you need to choose a DPR within that country. It both makes sense and is compulsory. If, on the other hand, your EU users are spread out in many countries, simply because you have an internet site, then you need to choose an EU DPR in one of the most populated countries in Europe (Germany, France, Spain or Italy). As your company does not have a clear majority, on the long term, in a given country you therefore need to choose a country where mechanically you will have many users.</p>
    <p>Some countries are considered to be more strict than others in regards to the GDPR. It would seem that this is linked to the fact that these countries are quite new to the Data Privacy laws and are therefore a little more abrupt than countries which have enforced these concepts for many years. France for instance set up Data Privacy laws in 1978 and has therefore, over the last forty years, learnt to be very practical and to fine only companies who refuse to comply after different warnings. It could be, therefore, interesting to choose your EU Representative in one of the more “mature” countries in regards to the Data Privacy Regulations.</p>
    <p>Having said this it is important to note that for non EU companies the “One stop shop” does not apply. This means that, in the case of a data breach for instance, your representative will need to inform all the Data Protection Authorities of the countries where you have clients or users. So you may, nevertheless, be exposed to a strict DPA.</p>
    <p>Another interesting aspect to look into, when choosing your EU Representative, is the address. After all, your representative is your official presence in Europe. You are entitled to highlight this address on your website. For your European users or clients an address in a prestigious part of a European capital is a reassuring sign. This is a great advantage you should not miss.</p>
    <p>Finally the most important, by the end of the day, is to choose a representative which actually cares about your business. He will be the one who will need to defend your interests within Europe and answer your questions. A good EU Representative could really turn out to be a precious asset for your company. So choose carefully!</p>
